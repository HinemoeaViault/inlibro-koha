# Presets
    # ID      : Unique identifier for coding purposes, never displayed
    # Type    : Chart type. Right now only the values 'bar', 'stacked' and 'pie' are supported. To support more types, you need to edit the javascript
    # yLabels : Data series names. NEEDS to be an array. Single values for 'bar' and 'pie', multiple for 'stacked'
    # query   : SQL Query to fetch data. First row should be the label of the x-axis (or categories in a pie chart), following rows should be data values.
    #           You should have as many columns as yLabels (so 1 for 'bar' or 'pie', multiple for 'stacked')
# The charts in the both the selection page (home.tt) are ordered in the order they are here. The display page ends up being the same order because of how <form>s work.
